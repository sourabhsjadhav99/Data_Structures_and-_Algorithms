Time complexity-->counting number of steps to finish execution -- not depends on machine

Notations->
Big O - worst time complexity
omega Ω- worst time complexity
theta θ  - worst time complexity

n+C == n 

Constant time complexity --> O(1)  
Linear Time complexity -->  O(n)  single loop
Quadratic Time complexity -->  O(n**2)  nested loop
Cubic Time complexity -->  O(n**3)  nested loop
Logarithmic Time complexity 
If input size reduces half every iterations then O(log n)

Space Complexity
if algorithm-

Constant space complexity --> does not required any extra space  O(1)  
Linear space complexity -->  O(n)  rate of extra space is equal to input
If rate of extra space is less than inputthen O(log n)


Objects
Insert, Remove, Access ==> TC O(1)
Search ==> TC O(n) --> .keys, .values, .entries

Arrays
Insert, Remove at end, Access ==> TC O(1)  -->push, pop
Insert, Remove at start, Search==> TC O(n)  --> shift, unshift, splice, slice, concat, forEach, map , filter, reduce

Integers larger than square root do not need to be checked because whenever n=a*b one of the two factors a and b is less than or equal to square root of n
